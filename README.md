# Jellyfin.UWP
----------------------------

This is a UWP application for Windows store and Xbox to use Jellyfin. It should operate very similiar to the website. It is NOT hosting a browser version of the website. This is a native UWP application. This application will only be to watch media and not to administrate Jellyfin.

To note this will not have Live TV or Pictures. If someone would like to start adding that to this, that would be cool. I have neither so I can not build or test.
